10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161

BMR x Basic Activity Factor = TDEE
1.2: If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) = BMR x 1.2

1.375: If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) = BMR x 1.375

1.55: If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) = BMR x 1.55

1.725: If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) = BMR x 1.725

1.9: If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) = BMR x 1.9
